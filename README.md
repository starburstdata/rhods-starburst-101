## Demonstration
### Red Hat OpenShift Data Science + Starburst:  <br>  Access and Explore your Data

#### Introduction
**Red Hat OpenShift Data Science**, a managed cloud platform for Data Scientists and Developers of intelligent applications, supports the full Machine Learning lifecycle by providing a robust, scalable platform and a flexible, interactive environment for teams to do their work. 

**Starburst**, based on open source Trino (formerly PrestoSQL), is a massively parallel processing (MPP) ANSI SQL query engine. It provides a secure and performant single point of access to all of your data without having to first copy or move it to a central repository. 

**Starburst** focuses on the first, and often most difficult problem teams face when starting a new project - **The Acquisition and Preparation of Data**.

With **Starburst**, Data Scientists and Developers will be able to quickly and easily combine data from multiple sources to perform comprehensive analyses for their organizations.

**Starburst Galaxy** is the fully managed offering of Starburst.

**Starburst Enterprise** is the self-managed offering of Starburst.
